## Vulnerability Details
CVE-2023-26116 is a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability in AngularJS affecting the `angular.copy()` utility function when copying `RegExp` objects.

## The Vulnerability

### Problem
A regular expression used by the `angular.copy()` utility function to copy `RegExp` objects is vulnerable to **super-linear runtime due to backtracking**. With a large carefully-crafted input, this can result in catastrophic backtracking and cause a denial of service of the application.

### Impact
Attackers could:
1. **Cause denial of service** by triggering `angular.copy()` with malicious RegExp objects
2. **Freeze the browser UI** through excessive regex processing
3. **Consume excessive CPU resources** on the client side
4. **Degrade application performance** for affected users

### Technical Details
The vulnerability occurs when `angular.copy()` processes regular expressions constructed from user-provided patterns containing many characters. The internal regex used for copying exhibits catastrophic backtracking behavior.

This is essentially equivalent to:
```javascript
angular.copy(new RegExp(userProvidedPattern));
```

## Patch Information

### Commit Details
- **Commit SHA**: [ae991ac12](https://github.com/TJSTONE99/angular.js-lts/commit/ae991ac12537cd26655ab6f0b41d2f6c9344c080)
- **Author**: TJSTONE99
- **Date**: January 2, 2026
- **Message**: fix: CVE-2023-26116

### Fix Summary
The patch fixes ReDoS vulnerability in `angular.copy()` RegExp handling by replacing vulnerable regex with linear-time alternatives:

1. **Replaced vulnerable regex**: Rewrote RegExp copying logic to avoid catastrophic backtracking
2. **Linear-time processing**: Implemented efficient RegExp handling that scales linearly with input size
3. **Maintained functionality**: Preserved all existing `angular.copy()` behavior while eliminating ReDoS risk
4. **Comprehensive testing**: Added extensive test coverage for ReDoS scenarios

### Files Modified
- `src/Angular.js`
- `test/AngularSpec.js`

### Key Changes
The fix replaces the vulnerable regex pattern in the `angular.copy()` function with a safer alternative that processes RegExp objects without triggering catastrophic backtracking, while maintaining full compatibility with existing copy functionality and adding comprehensive test coverage for ReDoS scenarios.

### Pre-patch PoC
The `angular.copy()` utility function is vulnerable to super-linear runtime due to backtracking when copying `RegExp` objects constructed from user-provided patterns containing many characters, causing the browser tab to become unresponsive.

:::warning
**⚠️ WARNING:** Using large pattern lengths will cause the browser tab to become unresponsive.
:::

The demonstration below shows the issue by constructing a regular expression from a user-provided pattern and then copying it with `angular.copy()`. You can observe that the time increases super-linearly relative to the pattern length.

### Post-patch PoC
Malicious RegExp patterns no longer cause performance degradation, `angular.copy()` completes in reasonable time regardless of input size, and normal copy functionality remains intact.
