## Vulnerability Details
CVE-2022-25869 is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in AngularJS that affects textarea elements when using Internet Explorer.

## The Vulnerability

### Problem
A cross-site scripting vulnerability in AngularJS that affects textarea elements when using Internet Explorer. The vulnerability allows **malicious AngularJS expressions to be executed** when navigating back to a page containing a textarea with user-controlled content.

### Impact
Attackers could:
1. **Execute arbitrary JavaScript** in the victim's browser (Internet Explorer only)
2. **Steal sensitive user data** including cookies and session tokens
3. **Perform actions on behalf of the user** without their consent
4. **Compromise user sessions** through script injection

### Technical Details
The vulnerability occurs when malicious AngularJS expressions are placed in textarea elements and the user navigates away from the page and then returns using the browser's back button functionality in Internet Explorer. The expressions are then evaluated by AngularJS, leading to script execution.

Example malicious payload:
```javascript
{{ $eval.constructor('alert("Hacked!")')() }}
```

## Patch Information

### Commit Details
- **Commit SHA**: [b9f30db37](https://github.com/TJSTONE99/angular.js-lts/commit/b9f30db374ec76ccbaaf480f5c3b65773e4bcbd3)
- **Author**: TJSTONE99
- **Date**: January 3, 2026
- **Message**: fix: CVE-2022-25869 - dropped support for internet explorer

### Fix Summary
The patch fixes the XSS vulnerability by completely removing Internet Explorer support from AngularJS:

1. **Dropped IE support**: Removed all Internet Explorer-specific code paths and workarounds
2. **Eliminated vulnerability**: By removing IE support, the textarea XSS vulnerability is completely eliminated
3. **Modernized codebase**: Simplified code by removing legacy browser compatibility layers
4. **Comprehensive cleanup**: Removed IE-specific tests, polyfills, and conditional logic throughout the codebase

### Files Modified
- **55 files modified**
- Major changes to core files: `src/Angular.js`, `src/jqLite.js`, `src/ng/compile.js`
- Extensive test suite updates and cleanup
- Added modern browser testing infrastructure with Playwright

### Key Changes
The fix takes a comprehensive approach by completely removing Internet Explorer support from AngularJS. This eliminates not only CVE-2022-25869 but also prevents future IE-specific vulnerabilities. The changes include:

- Removal of IE-specific DOM manipulation code
- Elimination of IE conditional compilation and feature detection
- Cleanup of IE-specific test cases and workarounds
- Addition of modern browser testing infrastructure

This approach ensures the vulnerability cannot occur while modernizing the codebase for better maintainability.
