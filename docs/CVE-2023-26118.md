## Vulnerability Details
CVE-2023-26118 is a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability in AngularJS affecting URL validation in input elements.

## The Vulnerability

### Problem
A regular expression used for URL validation in input elements is vulnerable to **super-linear runtime due to backtracking** when processing URLs with many trailing slashes. This can result in catastrophic backtracking and cause a denial of service.

### Impact
Attackers could:
1. **Cause denial of service** by triggering URL validation with malicious URL patterns
2. **Freeze the browser UI** through excessive regex processing
3. **Consume excessive CPU resources** on the client side
4. **Degrade application performance** for affected users

### Technical Details
The vulnerability occurs when URL validation processes URLs containing many consecutive trailing slashes. The internal regex used for URL validation exhibits catastrophic backtracking behavior with such input.

This is essentially equivalent to:
```javascript
// URL validation on input with type="url"
<input type="url" ng-model="userUrl" />
// Where userUrl = 'scheme:' + '/'.repeat(largeNumber)
```

## Patch Information

### Commit Details
- **Commit SHA**: [901317a35](https://github.com/TJSTONE99/angular.js-lts/commit/901317a35b3d8dec2da7421e5e0ac0f4d8ab9ef2)
- **Author**: TJSTONE99
- **Date**: January 2, 2026
- **Message**: fix: CVE-2023-26118

### Fix Summary
The patch fixes ReDoS vulnerability in URL validation by replacing vulnerable regex with linear-time alternatives:

1. **Replaced vulnerable regex**: Rewrote URL validation logic to avoid catastrophic backtracking
2. **Linear-time processing**: Implemented efficient validation that scales linearly with input size
3. **Maintained functionality**: Preserved all existing URL validation behavior while eliminating ReDoS risk
4. **Comprehensive testing**: Added extensive test coverage for ReDoS scenarios

### Files Modified
- `src/ng/directive/input.js`
- `test/ng/directive/inputSpec.js`

### Key Changes
The fix completely rewrites the URL validation logic to use linear-time algorithms instead of vulnerable regex patterns. The new implementation processes URLs character by character, avoiding the backtracking behavior that caused the ReDoS vulnerability while maintaining full compatibility with existing validation rules.

### Pre-patch PoC
URL validation in input elements is vulnerable to super-linear runtime due to backtracking when processing URLs with many trailing slashes, causing the browser tab to become unresponsive.

:::warning
**⚠️ WARNING:** Using large URLs will cause the browser tab to become unresponsive.
:::

The demonstration below shows the issue by validating a URL containing many trailing slashes. You can observe that the time increases super-linearly relative to the number of slashes.

### Post-patch PoC
Malicious URL patterns no longer cause performance degradation, URL validation completes in reasonable time regardless of input size, and normal validation functionality remains intact.
