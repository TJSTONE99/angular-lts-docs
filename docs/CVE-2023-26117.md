## Vulnerability Details
CVE-2023-26117 is a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability in AngularJS affecting the `$resource` service when processing URLs with trailing slashes.

## The Vulnerability

### Problem
A regular expression used by the `$resource` service to process URLs is vulnerable to **super-linear runtime due to backtracking** when processing URLs with many trailing slashes. This can result in catastrophic backtracking and cause a denial of service.

### Impact
Attackers could:
1. **Cause denial of service** by triggering `$resource` with malicious URL patterns
2. **Freeze the browser UI** through excessive regex processing
3. **Consume excessive CPU resources** on the client side
4. **Degrade application performance** for affected users

### Technical Details
The vulnerability occurs when `$resource` processes URLs containing many consecutive trailing slashes. The internal regex used for URL processing exhibits catastrophic backtracking behavior with such input.

This is essentially equivalent to:
```javascript
$resource('https://example.com/something/' + '/'.repeat(largeNumber) + 'bar');
```

## Patch Information

### Commit Details
- **Commit SHA**: [c6c975c5a](https://github.com/TJSTONE99/angular.js-lts/commit/c6c975c5ae552abc86b6fb2a5175f09c7b59e502)
- **Author**: TJSTONE99
- **Date**: January 2, 2026
- **Message**: fix: CVE-2023-26117

### Fix Summary
The patch fixes ReDoS vulnerability in `$resource` URL processing by replacing vulnerable regex with linear-time alternatives:

1. **Replaced vulnerable regex**: Rewrote URL processing logic to avoid catastrophic backtracking
2. **Linear-time processing**: Implemented efficient URL handling that scales linearly with input size
3. **Maintained functionality**: Preserved all existing `$resource` behavior while eliminating ReDoS risk
4. **Minimal changes**: Focused fix with minimal code changes to reduce regression risk

### Files Modified
- `src/ngResource/resource.js`

### Key Changes
The fix replaces the vulnerable regex pattern in the `$resource` service with a safer alternative that processes URLs character by character, avoiding the backtracking behavior that caused the ReDoS vulnerability while maintaining full compatibility with existing resource functionality.

### Pre-patch PoC
The `$resource` service is vulnerable to super-linear runtime due to backtracking when processing URLs with many trailing slashes, causing the browser tab to become unresponsive.

:::warning
**⚠️ WARNING:** Using large URL suffixes will cause the browser tab to become unresponsive.
:::

The demonstration below shows the issue by creating a `$resource` with a URL containing many trailing slashes. You can observe that the time increases super-linearly relative to the number of slashes.

### Post-patch PoC
Malicious URL patterns no longer cause performance degradation, `$resource` completes in reasonable time regardless of input size, and normal resource functionality remains intact.
